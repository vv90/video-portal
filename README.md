This is an evaluation project application written on angularJS
Karma/Jasmine is used for testing

I usually use webpack for bundling the application.
But since it's not listed in the allowed frameworks I decided not to use it.


To run the application you need to start node server.
There's npm script set up for this "npm start".
Or you just run "node index.js" from the terminal
After the node server is started (by default on port 3000) you can open the app in the browser

There's npm script for running tests on Karma "npm test"
